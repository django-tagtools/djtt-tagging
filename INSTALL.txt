Thanks for downloading djtt-tagging.

To install it, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer you can simply place the included ``tagging`` directory somewhere on your Python path, or
symlink to it from somewhere on your Python path; this is useful if you're working from a Subversion checkout.

If you are upgrading from django-tagging to djtt-tagging, you can upgrade your database structure to the newest
version using South (In order for this to work, you need to be on the last version of django-tagging). For more
information on installing South, visit http://south.aeracode.org/. Once south has been installed, your tagging
database can be upgraded by running the following commands from within your Django project directory:

    python manage.py migrate tagging 0001 --fake
    python manage.py migrate tagging

Note that this application requires Django 1.3 or later. You can obtain Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
