=======================
Django TagTools Tagging
=======================

This is a generic tagging application for Django projects, originally based off of brosner/django-tagging which is no longer maintained. Our intent is to maintain an upgrade path from django-tagging through the use of South migrations.

In an effort to help keep a Django tagging project moving forward and not stagnate like many others, this project has been put under a GitHub "organization". The idea being that if the current maintainers no longer can maintain it, that the baton can be easily passed on to someone else.

For installation instructions, see the file "INSTALL.txt" in this
directory; for instructions on how to use this application, and on
what it provides, see the file "overview.txt" in the "docs/"
directory.
